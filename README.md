MODELING OF STRENGTH OF HIGH PERFORMANCE CONCRETE USING ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS.
High Performance Concrete (HPC) generally consist of 8 ingredients mixed in various proportions, 
these are Cement, Blast Furnace Slag, Fly Ash, Water, Super-plasticizer, Coarse Aggregate, Fine Aggregate 
and Age which affects the strength of the HPC.
An Artificial Neural Network based approach is used in order to modify the given problem with the above-mentioned number of parameters 
and to see the prediction of strength values using soft computing techniques.
The data is taken from UCI Machine Learning Repository.
